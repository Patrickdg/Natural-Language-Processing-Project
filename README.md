# Predictive Text App - Natural Language Processing
This project was prepared as a capstone project for the Coursera/John Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

## Synopsis
A **predictive text application** was developed using a corpora of *[English text from blog, news, and twitter sources](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip)*.   
\newline  

Using a **5-gram dictionary** paired with a *'Stupid Backoff' model*, the application predicts the next word of sentences from user input with a top prediction rate of 11.51% and top-3 rate of 21.31%. 

The final application can be found [here](https://patrickdg.shinyapps.io/PredictiveTextApp/).
