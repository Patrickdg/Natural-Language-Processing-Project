# Predictive Text App - Natural Language Processing
This project was prepared as a capstone project for the Coursera/John Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

## Synopsis
Using text data from blogs, twitter, and news sources, natural language processing techniques were explored to develop a model to predict text following user input. 

Overall, ______________ insert results here (model development, assumptions made, size + speed considerations, prediction accuracy) _________________

## Techniques
Tokenization, word frequencies, and wordclouds were used to explore the data, and a 'Stupid Back-off' model with a uni- to quint-gram dictionary (i.e., a 5-gram model) was used to develop the final predictive model.
