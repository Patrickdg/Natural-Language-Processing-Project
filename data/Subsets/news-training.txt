"How might you know that Canadian folk-rocker Roxanne Potvin used to be a blues singer? Perhaps you can tell by how well she’s able to make effective, compelling music from the most rudimentary materials. Many of the songs on “Play” are little more than a simple, repetitive melody sung in Potvin’s modest voice, some sandpaper guitar and a straightforward drumbeat. The French-language “Dis-Moi Que Tu M’Aimes” is little more than a shout, a swirling Farfisa riff and a few well-timed halts by the rhythm section; somehow, it’s irresistible. “Pretty Girls” repeats its title over and over like a drawled mantra — it’s more hypnotic Velvet Underground than modern pop. “Let Me Go” is little more than a blurt, but it’s certainly an arresting one. Potvin keeps things punchy by getting in and out of her songs quickly — several tracks on “Play” barely break the two-minute mark. It’s all such fun that by the time she drops her languid cover of Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” on you at the conclusion of the album, you’ll barely mind. Fans of Liz Phair’s early insouciance and Lucinda Williams’ occasional whimsy should search this out."

Jonathan Ericsson has shown himself a good partner for Nicklas Lidstrom, providing a 6-foot-4 presence who gives Lidstrom some room. Kronwall and Brad Stuart would be many a team's top pairing, giving Detroit a top-four who'll share minutes equally, whereas Nashville leans heavily on Suter and Weber.

It’s a brick-walled haunt with beer on tap and its world-famous Rippers — hot dogs that split apart when deep-fried. There’s a side dining room, but the routine at Rutt’s is to eat your dog standing up at one of the tables in the ordering area. A healthy dose of Jersey attitude comes with your hot dog. “This is the best hot dog you will have all day,” co-owner John Karagiorgis says. “Savor the moment.” There were rumors in hot-dog cyberspace several years ago that Rutt’s was about to close, but Karagiorgis quickly shot them down. “Rutt’s Hut,’’ he says, “will never close.” Thank goodness.
