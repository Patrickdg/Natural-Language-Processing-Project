The last three are photographers, and their presence highlights both Dyer's range and the coherence of his point of view. Like Berger, he is willfully eclectic, opening the book with 19 essays on photography, moving to literature and music, and then less classifiable pieces: journalism and \"Personals.\" Yet like Berger also, this heterogeneity adds up to a wider outlook on the world."
